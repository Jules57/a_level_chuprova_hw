Today's grandparents are joining their grandchildren on social media, but the different generations' online 
    habits couldn't be more different. In the UK the over-55s are joining Facebook in increasing numbers, meaning that 
    they will soon be the site's second biggest user group, with 3.5 million users aged 55–64 and 2.9 million over-65s.
    Sheila, aged 59, says, I joined to see what my grandchildren are doing, as my daughter posts videos and photos of 
    them. It's a much better way to see what they're doing than waiting for letters and photos in the post. That's how 
    we did it when I was a child, but I think I'm lucky I get to see so much more of their lives than my grandparents
     did.
     Ironically, Sheila's grandchildren are less likely to use Facebook themselves. Children under 17 in the UK are 
     leaving the site – only 2.2 million users are under 17 – but they're not going far from their smartphones. Chloe,
      aged 15, even sleeps with her phone. 'It's my alarm clock so I have to,' she says. I look at it before I go to 
      sleep and as soon as I wake up.
      Unlike her grandmother's generation, Chloe's age group is spending so much time on their phones at home that they 
      are missing out on spending time with their friends in real life. Sheila, on the other hand, has made contact 
      with old friends from school she hasn't heard from in forty years. We use Facebook to arrange to meet all over 
      the country,' she says. 'It's changed my social life completely.
